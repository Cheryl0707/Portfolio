                    <h3>Chapel Speaker</h3>
                    <p>We were inspired by the Notre Dame de Paris and the Victor Hugo novel of the same name to create a bluetooth speaker with a distinctive gothic style modeled after the cathedral. We incorporated the pointed arches, stained-glasses windows, ribbed vaults, and spires into the speaker form and designed the speaker to provide an immersive acoustic experience and excellent aesthetic experience for the user. The main Bluetooth speaker is stored in the middle under the engraved wood panel and users can remotely control the speaker with digital devices.

                    <h3>Music Recitals in Holland Park</h3>
                    <p>We were inspired by Holland park since this location is very void and spacious, there is a lot of sunlight that is able to enter the pavilion. As our main theme of the pavilion design is nature, we hope that more natural light could enter the interior space and so we have chosen a location that could get in touch with the most sunlight during day time. That could help enrich users' experience on the aspect of nature when they enter our pavilion. Furthermore, since there is a large blank meadow facing the front entrance, users can actually see sceneries, buildings, and trees from the far side. With the use of grass, we have created an open but also private space for people to enjoy their time within the pavilion. Overall, with the help of natural lights and sceneries, users can enjoy the time and space inside our pavilion by temporary putting down the oppression that daily life brought them, </p>
