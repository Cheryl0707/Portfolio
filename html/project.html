                    <h3>Chapel Speaker</h3>
                    <p>We were inspired by the Notre Dame de Paris and the Victor Hugo novel of the same name to create a bluetooth speaker with a distinctive gothic style modeled after the cathedral. We incorporated the pointed arches, stained-glasses windows, ribbed vaults, and spires into the speaker form and designed the speaker to provide an immersive acoustic experience and excellent aesthetic experience for the user. The main Bluetooth speaker is stored in the middle under the engraved wood panel and users can remotely control the speaker with digital devices.
